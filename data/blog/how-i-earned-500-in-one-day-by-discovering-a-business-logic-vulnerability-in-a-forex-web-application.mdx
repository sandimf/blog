## Introduction

During a security assessment, I identified a **business logic vulnerability** in a forex trading web application.  
The issue stemmed from **insufficient validation and authorization checks**, which enabled me to:

- Transfer funds from another user’s account.  
- Withdraw funds using an account that did not own the balance.  

For responsibly reporting this vulnerability, I received a **$500 reward within one day**.  
This case demonstrates how improper validation of user actions can lead to **severe financial and reputational risks** for organizations in the fintech industry.

## Vulnerability Details

The application failed to properly enforce ownership validation when performing critical actions such as **fund transfers and withdrawals**. By manipulating requests at the business logic layer, I was able to execute transactions on behalf of other accounts without authorization.  

### Impact
- Unauthorized fund movement between accounts.  
- Potential for large-scale financial fraud.  
- Loss of trust in the platform’s integrity.  

### Root Cause
The application relied solely on client-side or insufficient server-side checks to verify whether the requesting account truly owned the funds being transferred or withdrawn.

## Recommendations

To mitigate this vulnerability, the following actions are recommended:

1. **Enforce strict server-side validation** to ensure that only the rightful account owner can initiate transfers and withdrawals.  
2. **Implement robust authorization controls** at every sensitive function.  
3. **Add audit logging and anomaly detection** for unusual transaction behavior.  
4. **Conduct regular security assessments** focusing on business logic flaws.  

## Conclusion

This case highlights how business logic vulnerabilities, though less technical than traditional exploits, can have **serious real-world consequences**, especially in the financial sector.  
By addressing validation gaps and strengthening authorization controls, organizations can significantly reduce their exposure to these high-impact risks.  

As a security researcher, this finding not only improved the platform’s security posture but also rewarded me with **$500 in just one day** — a clear reminder of the value of responsible disclosure.
